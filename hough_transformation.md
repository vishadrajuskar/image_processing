**EXTRACTING LINES â€“ (HOUGH TRANSFORM)**

The Hough Transformation is a great way to detect lines in an image and it is quite useful for a number of Computer Vision tasks.

The Hough transform is a feature extraction technique used in image analysis, computer vision, and digital image processing.
The purpose of the technique is to find imperfect instances of objects within a certain class of shapes by a voting procedure.
This voting procedure is carried out in a parameter space, from which object candidates are obtained as local maxima in a so-called accumulator space
that is explicitly constructed by the algorithm for computing the Hough transform.
The classical Hough transform was concerned with the identification of lines in the image, but later
the Hough transform has been extended to identifying positions of arbitrary shapes, most commonly circles or ellipses.
