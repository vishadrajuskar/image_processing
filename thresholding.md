**Thresholding**

Thresholding is the simplest method of image segmentation.

From a grayscale image, thresholding can be used to create binary images

*How it works ?*

The simplest thresholding methods replace in an image with a black pixel if the 
image intensity I(i, j)is less than some fixed constant T (that is, I(i,j) < T) or a white pixel if the image intensity is greater than that constant.

*Types of thresholding*

1. Global

2. Adaptive

3. Histogram based
