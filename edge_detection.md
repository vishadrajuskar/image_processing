**Concept of Edge Detection**

*What are edges ?*
Sudden changes of discontinuities in an image are called as edges.
Significant transitions in an image are called as edges.

A picture with edges is shown below.

**Types of edges**

Geenerally edges are of three types:

    Horizontal edges

    Vertical Edges

    Diagonal Edges

**Why detect edges**

Most of the shape information of an image is enclosed in edges.
So first we detect these edges in an image and by using these filters
and then by enhancing those areas of image which contains edges,
sharpness of the image will increase and image will become clearer.

Some of the Edge Detection methods I know are,
