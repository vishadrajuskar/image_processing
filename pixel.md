**Concept of Pixel**

*What is Pixel ?*

*Pixel* is the smallest element of an image.

Each pixel correspond to any one value. In an 8-bit gray scale image, the value of the pixel between 0 and 255.

The value of a pixel at any point correspond to the intensity of the light photons striking at that point.
Each pixel store a value proportional to the light intensity at that particular location.

**Calculation of total number of pixels**

We have define an image as a two dimensional signal or matrix.

Then in that case the number of pixel would be equal to the number of rows multiply with number of columns.

This can be mathematically represented as below:

Total number of pixels = number of rows * number of columns

Or we can say that the number of (x,y) coordinate pairs make up the total number of pixels.

**Gray level**

The value of the pixel at any point denotes the intensity of image at that location, and that is also known as *gray level*.

**Pixel Value**

*For Binary Image*

0 - Balck / Dark

1 - White

*Grayscale Image*

0 - Black / Dark

255 - White
