**Enhancement methods in image processing**

Image enhancement is the process of adjusting digital images so that the results are more suitable for display or further image analysis.

For example, you can remove noise, sharpen, or brighten an image, making it easier to identify key features.

Image Enhancement is done in two domains,

1) Spatial domain.
    -> Working with given image's pixels.
    -> Applying *transform* modifies the image
        f (x, y) = T (g(x, y))
    where,
        f(x,y) - output image
        g(x,y) - input image
        T is the transformation applied on g(x, y)
        
2) Frequency domain.


*some useful examples and methods of image enhancement:*

1. Filtering with morphological operators

2. Histogram equalization : 

3. Noise removal using a Wiener filter

4. Linear contrast adjustment

5. Median filtering

6. Unsharp mask filtering

7. Contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE)

8. Decorrelation stretch
